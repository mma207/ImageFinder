# ImageFinder
 
 This application is a simple app written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

 Once the app is running, you will be prompted to type a keyword in the search bar and hit enter on your keyboard. This will take you to a collection of images related to the keyword you typed. 

Every image is enlarged, presented in a modal upon clicking.
